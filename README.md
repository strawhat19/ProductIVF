git clone git@github.com:strawhat19/ProductIVF.git
cd ProductIVF/
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage

### Add a List

#### On the Home Page or the Lists Page, you can start by making simple Draggable, Droppable To Do Lists or just Lists in General of what you would like to Track!

### Add an Item

#### On the Home Page or the Lists Page, you can Add Items to the List and Update Them!

Prod [https://productivf.vercel.app/](https://productivf.vercel.app/) to see the prod build.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.mdx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
