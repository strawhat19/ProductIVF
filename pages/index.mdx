# ProductIVF

Welcome to ProductIVF! Right now im experimenting with making my own productivity app.

<div style={{marginTop: -20}}></div>

## Boards

***Sortable Draggable and Droppable Boards*** (Work in Progress).
I Wanted a way to quickly manage lists, to do lists, and subtasks. I used lots of productivity and project management apps, but they all seemed to be missing some feature I liked, so I'm experimenting with making my own just for fun! You can go to the dedicated [Boards](/projects/boards) page to get a more focused view!
