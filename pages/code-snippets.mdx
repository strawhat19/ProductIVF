# Code

These are some Code Snippets that I always find helpful, maybe you will too!

<div style={{marginTop: -20}}></div>

## Tips

If you are using JavaScript instead of TypeScript, you may need to  ***Remove Type Definitions.***

Turn `(objectWithTypeDefinition?: typeDefinition)` into `(objectWithoutTypeDefinition)`.

If you are using CSS instead of SCSS, you may need to take the children out of the parent!

Turn `Parent { Child { style } }` into `Parent Child { style }`.
