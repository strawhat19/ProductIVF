### Sanctuary

*A few years ago me and 4 of my other friends participated in an event called Global Game Jam, where teams have 48 hours to make a video game from scratch. There are a few big title games which actually spawned from this event, one example I can think of is Overcooked. Anyways, me and my friends got second place for our game that we made in Unity, Sanctuary! Since we didnt win first prize, we went back to our lives and Sanctuary stopped being worked on. Although we didn't win and although the game is unfinished, we had a blast making a game for the first time. I am putting this here as a reminder to myself to Continue Development of Sanctuary. If you are interested, here is a demo video game we made, Sanctuary!*

## Treasure Game

*Made a game for fun, it probably has bugs, but here it is. I made this one on my own and in 3 days. Considering this a step towards me learning more advanced game development.*
